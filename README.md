# __Dragamine-Game__

Dragamine is a simple frontend project inspired by the classic game Minesweeper. It consists of a 10x10 grid where each cell can either contain a bomb or a number representing the count of surrounding bombs. The objective of the game is to detect all the bombs by flagging or revealing the cells. The player who successfully identifies all the bombs wins the game.

This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on learning about data handling and manipulation using JavaScript. It utilizes a minimalistic tech stack to keep the project simple and easy to understand.

## __Features__

- 10x10 Grid: The game board is represented by a 10x10 grid, providing a sufficient challenge for players.

- Bombs and Numbers: Each cell in the grid can either contain a bomb or a number indicating the count of bombs in the surrounding cells.

- Flagging/Unflagging Cells: Players can flag or unflag cells to mark potential bomb locations.

- Revealing Cells: Players can click on cells to reveal their values.

- Win Condition: The game ends when all the bombs are successfully flagged by the player.

## __Tech Stack__
<br/>

Dragamine was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML: The project uses HTML for structuring the user interface and defining the game board grid.

- CSS: CSS is used for styling the game elements, including the grid layout, cell appearance, and overall visual presentation.

- JavaScript: The core logic of Dragamine is implemented in JavaScript. It handles data manipulation, game mechanics, and user interactions, such as flagging cells and revealing their values.

By incorporating this tech stack, you were able to create a dynamic and interactive game interface while keeping the project lightweight and straightforward.
